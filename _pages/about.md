Hi, [Justin](names) here. I'm a PhD candidate in [linguistics at the University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/). My main [research interests](research) include language variation and change, language contact and morphosyntax. I am particularly interested in minoritized language varieties, especially in the Sinitic family.
