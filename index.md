Hi. I'm Justin. I'm a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Toronto. My main research interests include language variation and change, language contact and morphosyntax. I am particularly interested in minoritized language varieties, especially in the Sinitic family.

This site is under construction. Stay tuned for more info about me.
